    - k.  Polyp: The sessile, tubular form of a cnidarian with a mouth and tentacles at one end and a basal disk at the other
    - l.  Medusa: A free-swimming cnidarian with a bell-shaped body and tentacles
    - m.  Epithelium: Animal tissue consisting of one or more layers of cells that have only one free surface, because the other surface adheres to a membrane or other substance
    - n.  Mesoglea: The jellylike substance that separates the epithelial cells in a cnidarian
    - o.  Nematocysts: Small capsules that contain a toxin which is injected into prey or predators
    - p.  Testes: Organs that produce sperm
    - q.  Ovaries: Organs that produce eggs
    - r.  Anterior end: The end of an animal that contains its head
    - s.  Posterior end: The end of an animal that contains its tail
    - t.  Circulatory system: A system designed to transport food and other necessary substances throughout a creature's body
    - u.  Nervous system: A system of sensitive cells that respond to stimuli such as sound, touch, and taste
    - v.  Ganglia: Masses of nerve cell bodies
    - w.  Hermaphroditic: Possessing both the male and the female reproductive organs
    - x.  Regeneration: The ability to regrow a missing part of the body
    - y.  Mantle: A sheath of tissue that encloses the vital organs of a mollusk, makes the mollusk's shell, and performs respiration
    - z.  Shell: A tough, multilayered structure secreted by the mantle, generally used for protection, but sometimes for body support
    - aa. Visceral hump: A hump that contains a mollusk's heart, digestive, and excretory organs
    - bb. Foot: A muscular organ that is used for locomotion and takes a variety of forms depending on the animal
    - cc. Radula: An organ covered in teeth that mollusks use to scrape food into their mouths
    - dd. Univalve: An organism with a single shell
    - ee. Bivalve: An organism with two shells
2.  No
3.  **a.** Bilateral **b.** Radial **c.** Bilateral **d.** Radial
4.  They suck in water continuously and eat the prey that it sucks in with the water
5.  Spongin, it serves the purpose of supporting the sponge
6.  The predominant method of asexual reproduction in a sponge is budding.
7.  Digesting food, transporting food and waste, exchanging gases, producing lime or silica
8.  Sponges produce gemmules when temperatures are freezing
9.  Hydra nematocysts are pressure sensitive and will activate upon brushing up against anything, whereas anemone nematocysts are chemical sensitive and will only activate upon sensing that specific chemical.
10. Cnidarians don't need respiratory or excretory systems because amoebocytes already serve the purposes of those system.
11. Because jellyfish can be both polyp form and medusa form
12. Medusa
13. Coral reefs
14. Structures:
    - a. Mouth
    - b. Ventral nerve cord
    - c. Seminal receptacles
    - d. Seminal vesicle
    - e. Ventral blood vessel
    - f. Nephridia with nephridiopores
    - g. Clitellum
    - h. Intestine
    - i. Dorsal blood vessel
    - j. Gizzard
    - k. Crop
    - l. Oviduct
    - m. Ovary
    - n. Esophagus
    - o. Aortic arches
    - p. Pharynx
    - q. Ganglia
15. Equalizing minerals and nutrients in the soil
16. It had recently reproduced.
17. Some hydras can mate with themselves, but earthworms can't. Earthworms create both eggs and sperm, which some hydras do, but most hydras produce one or the other.
18. It will suffocate.
19. Their intestine branches extend throughout most of the body so food never has to go far enough from the intestine to justify a full circulatory system
20. Parasitic
21. Regeneration
22. **a.** Cnidaria **b.** Mollusca **c.** Porifera **d.** Platyhelminthes **e.** Annelida
