# Module 9 Study Guide

by Carter Lavering

1.  a. The idea that each species was created by God and cannot change at all

    b. A species adapting to its environment while remaining the same animal for the most part

    c. The theory that over time a species can change into an entirely different animal

    d. Layers of rock

    e. Preserved bodies of animals

    f. The study of fossils

    g. The study of similar structures in different animals

2. The Galapagos Islands
3. No.
4. That animals compete to survive.
5. That the present is the key to the past.
6. The immutability of species
7. Macroevolution.
8. Microevolution.
9. Microevolution modifies genes, whereas macroevolution adds new genes.
10. The geological column is neither for nor against macroevolution because it can be interpreted to be either. The fossil record is against it, since there are no intermediate links. Structural homology is against, since although parts are similar, they are made by entirely different genes. Molecular biology is against, because organisms that are more "similar" don't necessarily have more similar genes.
11. Archaeopteryx, because it's actually a bird, and Australopithecus, because the argument rests entirely on the speculation that its hips might be configured in a certain way.
12. It refers to the fact that all sorts of "complex" life that shouldn't have existed yet suddenly did come along with early "simple" life in Cambrian rock. How did they evolve so quickly?
13. Conjugation, transformation, transduction, and mutation.
14. No information is received.
15. b.
16. The bacterium.
17. That changes like that can't occur normally.
18. The lack of intermediary fossils.
19. They didn't live very long due to radiation and whatnot and so there are no fossils of them.
20. Molecular biology and structural homology
