1. **a.** The study of the interactions between living and nonliving things
   **b.** A group of interbreeding organisms coexisting together
   **c.** A group of populations living and interacting in the same area
   **d.** An association of living organisms and their physical environment
   **e.** A group of ecosystems classified by climate and plant life
   **f.** An organism that eats producers
   **g.** An organism that eats primary consumers
   **h.** An organism that eats secondary consumers
   **i.** A diagram that shows the biomass of organisms at each trophic level
   **j.** A measure of the total dry mass of organisms within a particular region
   **k.** Evaporation of water from the leaves of a plant
   **l.** An ecosystem where all water runoff drains into a single body of water
   **m.** The process by which certain gases (principally water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane) trap heat that would otherwise escape the earth and radiate into space
2. Because foreign animals can unbalance the ecosystem and cause havoc, like the rabbits in Australia.

4. Primary and secondary consumers
5. Secondary and tertiary
6. Clownfish (scare predators) and sea anemone (protect clownfish), blind shrimp (make home) anf goby (warn of danger), Oriental sweetlips (provide food) and blue-streak wrasse (clean teeth)
7. The ocean has other ways of getting water, such as surface runoff.
8. Transportation of water between ecosystems
9. Less transpiration and algal blooms from too much nutrients
10. Respiration, photosynthesis
11. Ozone formation, rusting, fire
12. Water vapor destruction, ozone destruction
13. Dissolving into ocean, photosynthesis
14. Fire, fuel burning, respiration, decomposition
15. Burning lots of fuel
16. No
17. When nitrogen is turned into ammonia, nitrogen-fixing bacteria
18. Decomposition and denitrification
