## Activity 3

1. He wanted a portrait of Franklin as well as his opinion of Jesus.

3. He believed in one God who created the universe who still governs it by his Providence, that he ought to be worshipped, that we please him the most when we do good to his other children, and that the soul of man is immortal and will be judged in another life according to its actions in this one.
4. Franklin says Jesus was a good teacher, but that he might not actually _be_ God. He says he hadn't studied it and thus didn't bother himself with it, but the Bible states that Jesus is God. Jesus himself stated that he is the Son of God but that people who aren't his sheep won't believe him. Apparently Franklin wasn't a sheep of God.

## Activity 4

1. According to Exodus 12:40, the Israelites lived in Egypt for 430 years, not 200 as Voltaire says.  It's still massive growth, but the Bible says that they were exceedingly numerous, acknowledging that the growth was unusual.
2. _Voltaire asks how Pharaoh could pursue the Jews with horsemen since Egypt's horses supposedly died in the fifth and sixth plagues. How does that assertion hold up when compared to Exodus 9:1-12, where those plagues are described?_
3. Voltaire describes him as weak and useless, but in Deuteronomy 34:7 it says that even at a hundred and twenty years old he still had his strength and his eyesight. In Exodus 3:10, it says that God sent _him_ specifically. God wouldn't send someone who was useless, would he?
4. _How do Voltaire's comments illustrate Romans 1:18-22 and 2 Peter 3:14-16?_
5. _How does Voltaire's view of history reflect the ideas and attitudes of the Enlightenment?_

2. A tired horse as well as traffic.
3. Three or four thousand people
4. Young, slim, slender, angelic
5. His righteousness could not save him
6. No, but that's partly because our culture today has manufactured so many "alternatives" to the Gospel and partly because three's a church every couple blocks where someone preaches at least once a week.

16. He casts the past into the anti-Christian light of the Enlightenment and blamed not only the barbarian tribes but also Christianity for introducing controversy and thus weakness into the Roman Empire.
